Created a portfolio that has the following HTML pages:
Home: The homepage containing my data (bio).

Contact: The contact page containing links to my social media.

About: The about me page containing brief information about me.


Created a server using the HTTP module.
Created routes that render the HTML pages created on a browser.
The base URL renders the homepage.
There is a /home route that redirects to the base of your app.
